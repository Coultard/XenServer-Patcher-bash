The first time I had to manually apply 4 patches and the seconds time I had about 6. I decided to make my own little upgrade script.\r\nFeel free to use it in any way you want.\r\n\r\nI did some testing on a couple of 6.2 installations and as long as you ave enough disk space you should not see any errors.\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
